# Layer: Reservoirs

The Reservoirs layer corresponds to reservoirs in the StateMod dataset.
These are locations where water is stored for seasonal and long-term drought supply.
The model includes some regional aggregate reservoirs, which combine the capacity and
water rights of smaller reservoirs.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this map:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Reservoirs layer | Model identifiers are extracted from the StateMod `*.res` file and corresponding coordinates are extracted from HydroBase. |

## Map Creation Workflow

The workflow to create the map can be found in the
[StateMod Web GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-app-statemod-web/tree/master/webroot/datasets/colorado/2015/workflow).
