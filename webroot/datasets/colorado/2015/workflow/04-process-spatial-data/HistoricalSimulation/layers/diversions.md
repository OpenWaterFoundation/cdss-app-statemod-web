# Layer: Diversions

The Diversions layer corresponds to direct diversion stations in the StateMod dataset.
These are locations where water is diverted from the surface water system,
for example with a ditch or pipeline.
Water that is diverted may be directly applied to a consumptive use or may be carried to storage.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this map:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Diversions layer | Model identifiers are extracted from the StateMod `*.dds` file and corresponding coordinates are extracted from HydroBase. |

## Map Creation Workflow

The workflow to create the map can be found in the
[StateMod Web GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-app-statemod-web/tree/master/webroot/datasets/colorado/2015/workflow).
