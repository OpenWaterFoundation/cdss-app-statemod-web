## Background

The Historical Simultation Dataset map shows basin features that are included in the
StateMod historical simulation (H + H2 model runs).
The historical time series data are used to calibrate the historical simulation
including diversions and reservoir contents.

See the following resources for more information:

## Layer Groups

The following layer groups are included in this map.

| **Layer Group** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| Streamflow Stations | Streamflow stations from model dataset, with coordinates from HydroBase. |
| Reservoirs | Reservoirs from model dataset, with coordinates from HydroBase. |
| Diversions | Diversions from model dataset, with coordinates from HydroBase. |
| Stream Reaches | Stream reaches from the Division of Water Resources' (DWR's) Source Water Route Framework, and instream flow reaches and termini from the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB). |
| Background Layers | Background layers that provide a frame of reference. |
