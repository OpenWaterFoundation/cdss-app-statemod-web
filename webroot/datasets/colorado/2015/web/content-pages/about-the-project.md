# About the Project #

This web application provides a simple interface for the Upper Colorado basin water allocation model dataset
available from Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS).
The project was funded by a Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) Severance Tax grant.

This web application relies on pre-generated files that have been uploaded to the cloud.
Maps present the model "nodes" and other spatial data.
Map features can be moused over to provide information about map features.
Model node map features can be clicked on to provide access to time series data at the nodes.
Due to the complexity of data preparation and running the model, the model input cannot be changed and
the model cannot be run from this website.

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise
that develops open source software and open data solutions to make better decisions about water.
OWF has worked for years to develop water resources tools such as
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](https://www.colorado.gov/cdss),
and recently [OpenCDSS](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/),
which is the open source initiative for CDSS software tools.
