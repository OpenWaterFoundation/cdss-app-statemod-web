# CDSS Colorado (cm2015) Dataset (Prototype) #

This website provides a simple map-based interface to Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS) Upper Colorado
surface water supply simulation model dataset.
The information on this website was created as follows:

1. The latest `cm2015` dataset has been downloaded from the [CDSS website](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/surface-water-statemod).
2. [StateMod modeling software](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/statemod) was run to simulate water allocation.
3. Input and output in large files was split into files for each model "node".
4. The files were uploaded to the cloud and this web application was configured to display the maps and time series.

Menus are provided for important dataset components and reflect the work necessary to create a simulation model
that is suitable for water resources planning.
**Avoid using the browser refresh page button unless necessary because the application implements its own page navigation.**

See the [Upper Colorado Model Documentation](https://dnrweblink.state.co.us/cwcb/0/doc/200075/Electronic.aspx?searchid=d8eca6f8-7cfe-4ddf-9788-5886fd932c8c)
for detailed information about the model (**Warning:  large/slow PDF download).

See the ***About this Project*** menu for details about project implementation.

### **This website is under development.  Currently, menus are an outline for features that are being phased in over time.** ###
